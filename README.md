#   UB-School-Safety-Simulation
In this project, we implemented complex coding functionalities using Unity, which include the dynamic interaction of patrollers and attackers in a virtual environment. We also added random NPCs that would behave differently and would head to some sort of destination, further increasing the realism and randomness of the simulation. It also included the analysis of FBI data with a sample size of more than 50 cases and applied game theory to mimic real-life school shooter behavior; hence, it provided quite a unique insight into such a critical issue.
